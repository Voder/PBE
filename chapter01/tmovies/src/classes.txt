Classes let you package data and functions together in one unit

:pause 3

Classes also allow you to inherit behaviour from other classes

:pause 4

A simple class with no data or methods:

    >>> class A(object): pass

:pause 4

Let's make an instance:

    >>> a = A()

:pause 2

The instance has no attributes or methods because the class did not have any, but we can add some
attributes and use the instance simply to store data:

    >>> a.x = 1
    >>> a.y = "hi"
    >>> a.x; a.y
    1
    'hi'


    >>> class Tree(object):
    ...  height = 0

:pause 4

    >>> birch = Tree()

:pause 4

    >>> birch.height
    0

:pause 4

    >>> def grow(tree): tree.height += 1
    >>> grow(birch)
    >>> birch.height
    3


:pause 4

    >>> class Tree(object):
    ...  height = 0
    ...  def grow(self):
    ...   self.height += 1

:pause 4

    >>> bamboo = Tree()

:pause 4

    >>> birch.grow(); birch.height
    1

:pause 4

    >>> birch.grow(); birch.height
    2

:pause 4

    >>> bamboo.height
    0

:pause 4
