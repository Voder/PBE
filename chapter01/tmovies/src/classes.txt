Classes let you package data and functions together in one unit

:pause 3

Classes also allow you to inherit behaviour from other classes

:pause 4

A simple class with no data or methods:

    >>> class A(object): pass

:pause 4

Let's make an instance:

    >>> a = A()

:pause 2

The instance has no attributes or methods because the class did not have any, but we can add some
attributes and use the instance simply to store data:

    >>> a.x = 1
    >>> a.y = "hi"
    >>> a.x; a.y
    1
    'hi'


    >>> class Tree(object):
    ...  height = 0

:pause 4

    >>> birch = Tree()

    >>> birch.height
    0

:pause 4

Now I'd like to make a small function to make the tree grow one centimeter, or foot, or what have
you, at a time:

    >>> def grow(tree):
    ...     tree.height += 1

    >>> grow(birch); grow(birch)
    >>> birch.height
    2

:pause 4

That's really great but it would make even more sense if the tree class itself knew how to grow
itself. Certainly, a real tree does know how to grow.

:pause 4

In the grow() function, we were passing the tree instance as an argument. In the class, we want to
do the same, but I'm going to call it 'self' instead of 'tree' -- the current instance is always
called 'self' by Python convention:

    >>> class Tree(object):
    ...  height = 0
    ...  def grow(self):
    ...   self.height += 1

:pause 4

Now we can tell the tree itself to grow:

    >>> birch = Tree()
    >>> birch.grow(); birch.height
    1
    >>> birch.grow(); birch.height
    2

:pause 4

It wasn't necessary to pass the instance as an argument because the class already handles that
automatically (the instance is passed as the first argument -- if you have additional arguments,
they have to be positioned after 'self').

:pause 4

You can add other trees and they all will have the same methods but will be independent instances
and will have their own sets of data:

    >>> bamboo = Tree()
    >>> bamboo.grow(); bamboo.height
    1
    >>> bamboo.grow(); bamboo.height
    2

:pause 4


    >>> birch.grow(); birch.height
    2

:pause 4

    >>> bamboo.height
    0

:pause 4
