List comprehensions are easy

:sleep 2

:type
List comprehensions let you process and filter lists with minimal effort

:sleep 5

Let's make a small list:

:type
    >>> lst = range(20)

:sleep 5

Now let's make a simple list comprehension that does not do ANYTHING:

    >>> [i for i in lst]

:sleep 5

This should give you a good idea of what elements you can have in a list
comprehension and where they are. In the example above, both elements are
absent, but you can have a processing element and a filter element:

    [process(i) for i in lst if filter(i)]

:sleep 12

Let's look at what you can do with the filter element:

    >>> [i for i in lst if i>5]

:sleep 5

    >>> [i for i in lst if i<5 or i>15]
